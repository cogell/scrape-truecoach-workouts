# Scrape TrueCoach Workouts

Using puppeteer to scrape workouts from my TrueCoach workouts over the past couple years and saving this to a JSON file.

## Conversation, Encrypted

I wanted to store a copy of all my coorespondce in TrueCoach in this repo too but didnt want that part to be public. So I encrypted it using my public key and stored it in the repo. To decrypt it, you'll need my private key.

For future me, here is a reminder how to decrypt: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-gpg-to-encrypt-and-sign-messages#decrypt-messages
